What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository using the command
  git init
the hidden git folder for tracking changes (called .git) is created, but no commits exist yet.
To see this, run the command
  git status
It's important to initialize the repository so that changes can be tracked.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an impermanent area between the working directory and the git repository. You add files here before you actually commit them to the git repo; if you accidentally add the wrong file, you can remove it. Once everything is squared away, then you can commit. It likely improves the quality/significance of each commit.
